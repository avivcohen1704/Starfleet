# Starfleet

## Description

The `Starfleet` project is a Java application designed to simulate the operations and management of a starfleet, including various types of spacecraft and their crew members. This sophisticated project illustrates my understanding of object-oriented programming principles, using polymorphism, inheritance, and interfaces to build a comprehensive simulation environment. It's a testament to my ability to conceptualize and implement complex systems using Java.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- Tools: Git for version control, IntelliJ IDEA for development

## Features

- Detailed simulation of a starfleet with different spacecraft types, including bombers, fighters, and transport ships.
- Management of crew members with different roles and ranks within the fleet.
- Implementation of advanced Java concepts such as interfaces, abstract classes, and threading.
- Demonstrates use of design patterns and best practices in software development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or newer.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/Starfleet.git
cd Starfleet
```
Import the project into your IDE and ensure JDK settings are correct.

## Running the Project
Run the "StarfleetManager" class from your IDE to start the simulation. Adjust parameters within the code to simulate different scenarios.

## Usage
Explore the project to understand the implementation of various spacecraft and crew management functionalities. The StarfleetTester class can be used to test and demonstrate the functionality of the created starfleet management system.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your enhancements
